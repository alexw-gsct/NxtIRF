Title: User-friendly Intron Retention and Alternative Splicing analysis using the IRFinder engine
Version: 0.98.0

Author: Alex C H Wong

Description: NxtIRF is the next evolution for Intron Retention detection for RNA-seq 
    data. NxtIRF is now fully compatible with Windows and Mac as well as Linux. In addition
    to analysis of bam files aligned to the genome using a splice-aware aligner (e.g. STAR),
    NxtIRF provides convenient pipelines for downstream analysis and publication-ready
    visualisation. Specifically, NxtIRF:
    - Allows reference generation using Bioconductor/AnnotationHub
    - Directly analyses BAM files (with compatibility for coordinate-sorted BAMs)
    - (TODO) IRFinder output collation across multiple samples
    - (TODO) Additionally analyse other forms of alternative splicing (using differential junction usage)
    - (TODO) Downstream analysis (currently uses DESeq2 or DSS)
    - (TODO) Visualisation of splice events, differential RNA-seq coverage across conditions, etc
